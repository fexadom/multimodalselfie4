# MultimodalSelfie v4
The MultimodalSelfie is a personal multimodal recording device designed for traditional classrooms. The device, owned and operated by the student, sits on top of her desk while recording video, audio, and notes during a class session (as seen in the concept image below); effectively taking a "selfie" of her learning experience.
